So basically we want to aggregate by the following

time -> name -> id

Do we even care about keeping the individual timing points? Possibly as they might be useful later.

Say we didn't though and we just cared about the time and the name

So you might end up with :

1. A collector that actually delegates out to other collectors
2. A collector that delegates to a statistic bucket

That would be all you need
